- add bibliography w/ paper screenshots
- mention GOF tests w/ U-CARE and R2ucare, chapter on Gentle introduction
- add some of our slides on multievent models
- add a slide Summary and/or Take-home messages
- add a slide w/ bibliography and/or To go further
- Write a slide w/ tricks to speed up the computations and improve convergence
    - Marginalization (cite relevant paper I review for Ecol Monog); by hand, or using what is done in Nimble/Stan. 
    - Nimble w/ NimbleEcology, Stan w/ tag Ecology
    - Provide examples of IPM w/ Stan, with Nimble, with TMB/ADMB 
    - m-arrays, but limitations when it comes to individual effect (random of covariates)
    - TMB, Rcpp; to get you started, I have some code
    - Other stuff?
- Introduce HMMs and our Ecol Let papers; actually, we use HMMs not general SSMs for IPMs; see also recent paper by Takis in Biometrics formulating IPMs as HMMs!
- Add an example of multievent model in the multistate R script? Use the roe deer example from my TPB paper; check out the examples we cover in 
- Put m-array stuff in another file, gathering single and multistate stuff (or two files, yet to be decided)
