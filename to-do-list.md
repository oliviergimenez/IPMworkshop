Overall

- If breeding example in lectures, use same recoding for non-detections, and modify Michael's function for inits for multievent.
- Prepare a slide or two on waic for cjs then anova, with sim and dipper
- Shall I use tablet/stylet?
- A few words to tell how we met back in Montpellier > 15 years ago Marc, Michael and I; Roger/Jean-Do in common, we're like cousin; introduce Maud 
- Tell how many neff we need for convergence

- ~~Clean up prez multievent, ajouter BUGS code~~
- ~~Dia de conclusion sur speed~~
- ~~Replace description du multi event par celle de Roger. Voir dans Base3. - Remplacer disease par breeding uncertainty, en lien avec l’exercice d’ailleurs.~~
- ~~initial states: Multistate. It is known exactly: alive at site of initial capture~~
- ~~Add the multi event are HMMs; Actually everything we've seen is an HMM.~~
- ~~Glisser des exemples de papiers pour chaque exemple (voir liste sur site workshop multievent); Cite Arnason-Schwarz papers~~
- ~~Transition between successive wintering sites can be viewed as involving two distinct processes: S : survival followed by Y : movement conditional on survival~~
- ~~Add a slide Summary and/or Take-home messages~~
- ~~Rajouter un example 0 pour montrer que CJS est un cas particulier de multistate; CJS is a multistate model with 2 states. Present CJS as a particular case of the multistate, as in https://github.com/oliviergimenez/multievent_jags_R~~
- ~~Insérer définition de dcat(); Illustrate what dcat does; Categorical is a special case of the multinomial distribution with n = 1; The argument of the dcat distribution is a vector of probabilities for each category.~~
- ~~Where in the book about generalized logic and dirichlet?~~
- ~~Add a few memes and animated gifs~~
- ~~Sort out what I will be demonstrating in the script~~
- ~~To maintain animations, duplicate slides instead of using powerpoint features, it makes the pdf conversion safer~~
- ~~Add bibliography w/ paper screenshots~~
- ~~Mention GOF tests w/ U-CARE and R2ucare, chapter on Gentle introduction~~
- ~~Add a slide w/ bibliography and/or To go further~~
- ~~Include pictures of key people in the capture-recapture world -> Rachel, Ruth, Eleni, Anita, etc.~~
- ~~Translate the R scripts in Rmd?~~
- ~~If too short to do the Rmd, just have a script for the lecture demo, and another one for exercises with and without solutions; show the matrices~~
- ~~Add an example of multievent model in the multistate R script? Use the roe deer example from my TPB paper https://github.com/oliviergimenez/multievent_jags_R; check out the examples we cover in our multievent workshops; make it an exercise;~~
- ~~The multistate example can be simplified and made faster, we don't need the loops on individuals/time to define the state matrices. In the exercise, we need the time loop. Mention that to add individual stuff, an extra loop on individuals is needed. Tension is with the lecture that presents the model with time and individual effect as the most general and generic model~~
- ~~Put m-array stuff in another file, gathering single and multistate stuff (or two files, yet to be decided)~~
- ~~Provide link to Nimble translation of book? Add Nimble implementation of the exercises? I won't do it; Maud has a full lecture to show-case Nimble~~
