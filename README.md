# Capture-recapture models in JAGS

This repository contains the material (slides, data and R code) I used
for a workshop on Integrated Population Models (IPMs) we held online 23
– 27 November 2020. This workshop was co-taught by Michael Schaub,
Marc Kéry, Olivier Gimenez and Maud Quéroué.

I introduce capture-recapture models in a state-space / hidden Markov
modeling framework. I also show how to fit these models in Jags. I cover
Cormack-Jolly-Seber, Arnason-Schwarz, multistate and multievent models.
