### EXERCISE 1: Fit a model with constant survival and detection probabilities to data simulated with constant parameters. 
# Fit a model with time-dependent survival and detection probabilities (CJS) to the same data.

###############
### EXERCISE 2: We are going to analyse real capture-recapture data.
# The data concern the European Dipper (Cinclus cinclus). 
# Captures were carried out for 7 years (1981-1987) in eastern France by G. Marzolin who kindly provided us with the data. 
# They consist of initial markings and recaptures of 293 breeding adults each year during the March-June period. 
# Birds were at least 1 year old when initially banded. 
# Estimate sex-specific survival, assuming constant capture probability.
# Add temporal variance on top of survival in the model.
# To get you started, we read in the data and clean up the data.

### EXERCISE 4: The purpose of the exercise is to build models incorporating uncertainty in the assignment of states. 
# We use (historical) data collected between 1940 and 1957 by Lance Richdale on Sooty shearwaters Puffinus griseus (titis hereafter). 
# These data were reanalyzed using multistate capture-recapture models by Scofield et al. (2001) who kindly provided us with the data. 
# Following the way the data were collected, four states were originally considered:
# (1) Breeder (SB);
# (2) Accompanied by another bird in a burrow;
# (3) Alone in a burrow;
# (4) On the surface.
# Because of numerical issues, we pooled 2-3-4 together in a Non-Breeder state (NSB) that includes 
# failed breeders (birds that had bred previously â€“ skip reproduction or divorce) and pre-breeders (birds that had yet to breed). 
# Note that because burrows were not checked before hatching, some birds in the category NSB might have already failed. 
# We therefore regard those birds in the SB state as successful breeders, and those in the NSB state as nonbreeders + prebreeders and failed breeders.
# We artificially generated uncertainty on the assignment of the two states Non-Successful-Breeder and Successful-Breeder as follows. 
# For each individual at each detection occasion: 1) a Non-Successful-Breeder was ascertained as Non-Successful-Breeder with probability 0.2 
# and assigned to obs 1, and not ascertained with the complementary probability 0.8 and assigned to obs 3, while 2) a Successful-Breeder 
# was ascertained as Successful-Breeder with probability 0.7 and assigned to obs 2, and not ascertained with the complementary probability 0.3 
# and assigned to obs 3.
# This procedure was implemented in R, see the script make-uncertain.R in the codes/ directory
# Try and fit a model with uncertainty in the state assignment. Consider 2 probabilities to ascertain the breeding status of an individual 
# encountered as Non-Successful-Breeder (deltaNB) or Successful-Breeder (deltaB).
